Good morning , everyone. I'm glad to be here today to discuss the importance of mental health and wellness in
the workplace. As we all know , mental health is just as important as physical health , and it
's essential that we prioritize it in our daily lives , especially in the workplace. Today , I want
to talk about the impact of mental health on productivity , absenteeism , and employee turnover .
First , let's talk about the impact of mental health on productivity. When employees are struggling
with mental health issues , it can affect their ability to focus , make decisions , and complete tasks
efficiently. This can lead to decreased productivity , which can have a ripple effect on the entire
organization. In fact , studies have shown that employees who experience mental health issues are
more likely to experience decreased productivity and absenteeism. Second , let's talk about the impact
of mental health on absenteeism. When employees are struggling with mental health issues , they may
need to take time off work to seek treatment or simply to take care of themselves. This can lead
to absenteeism , which can be costly for employers. In fact , the cost of absenteeism due
to mental health issues can be as high as $1,000 per employee per year. Finally ,
let's talk about the impact of mental health on employee turnover. When employees are struggling
with mental health issues , they may feel overwhelmed and burnt out , leading to turnover. In fact ,
studies have shown that employees who experience mental health issues are more likely to leave their
jobs. So , what can we do to support mental health in the workplace? First ,
we can create a culture of openness and acceptance. This means encouraging employees to speak up
about their mental health and creating a safe and supportive environment. Second ,
we can provide resources and support for employees who are struggling with mental health issues.
This can include access to counseling services , employee assistance programs , and mental health
resources. Finally ,
we can prioritize self-care and wellness in the workplace. This can include providing
resources and support for employees to prioritize their physical and mental health , such as
fitness classes , meditation rooms , and healthy snack options. In conclusion ,
mental health is just as important as physical health , and it's essential that we prioritize it in
the workplace. By creating a culture of openness and acceptance , providing resources and support ,
and prioritizing self-care and wellness , we can support the mental health and well-being of our
employees. Thank you.
